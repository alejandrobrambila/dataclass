# 1.2.5 Exercises ----
## 1. Why does this code not work? ----
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

#Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

## 2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly. ----
libary(todyverse)

ggplot(dTA = mpg) + 
  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm)
  
## 3. Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus? ----

## 4. Let’s revisit an exercise from the Section 1.6. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
